# Finite element methods for beam structures

This section and its sub-sections deal with finite element methods for beam structures. Finite element method is discussed in (more) detail in the 
[bbook about mathematics](https://basics2022.github.io/bbooks-math-miscellanea/intro.html), mainly in the sections about [partial differential equations (PDEs)](https://basics2022.github.io/bbooks-math-miscellanea/ch/pde/intro.html) and [numerical methods for PDEs](https://basics2022.github.io/bbooks-math-miscellanea/ch/pde/numerics.html).

Here, FEM are presented applied to:
- [**decoupled beam structures**](), where axial, torsional and shear-bending dynamics are nutually independent, and governed by eq... derived for a decoupled [Timoshenko beam](solid-mechanics:small-displacements:beams:timoshenko)
- [**generic beam structures**](solid-mechanics:intro:small-displacements-beam-fem:general), where a general coupling may exist between any kinematic variable and internal force/moment, as described for a general [Timoshenko beam](solid-mechanics:small-displacements:beams:timoshenko), eq...
