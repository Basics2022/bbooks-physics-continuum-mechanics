# Statics

The behavior of continuous medium in static conditions can be used to define a fluid. 

```{prf:definition} Fluid
A fluid can be defined as a continuous medium with no shear stress in static conditions. Thus, the stress tensor of an *isotropic fluid* under static conditions reads

$$\mathbb{T}^s = - p \mathbb{I} \ ,$$

where $p$ is *pressure*. (<span style="color:red"**todo** mechanical? Thermodynamical?</span>)
