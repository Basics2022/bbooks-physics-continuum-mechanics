# Ideal Fluids

Ideal fluids are defined as fluids with negligible viscosity and heat conduction. Under these assumptions, if no [shock](fluid-mechanics:compressible:inviscid:shocks) occurs, material derivative of entropy is zero and thus:
- each material particle has constant entropy
- if entropy is uniform at inflow boundaries $S_{inflow} \subseteq \partial V$, $S_{inflow}$ s.t. $(\vec{v} - \vec{v}_b) \cdot \hat{n} \lt 0$, entropy is uniform in the domain
